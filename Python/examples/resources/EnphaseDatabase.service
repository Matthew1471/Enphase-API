# Short human readable title of the unit. User-visible label to identify the unit.
Description=Enphase Database

# Reference to where the user can obtain more information about this service.
Documentation=https://github.com/Matthew1471/Enphase-API/

# This service will start once the system is ready for data (you can add rabbitmq-server.service and mariadb.service to both if on the same machine).
Requires=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

# Check that the Python script exists.
ConditionPathExists=/home/pi/Enphase/amqp_database_meters.py

# Do not restart more than 5 (default) times in 300 seconds.
StartLimitIntervalSec=300

[Service]

# Runs the executable and if it is alive will assume the service is running.
Type=simple

# Apply user privilege restrictions.
User=pi
Group=pi

# Delete the $PATH environment (V250+).
#ExecSearchPath=

# The process to start.

# The credentials file will need to be read based off the working directory.

# The time to sleep before restarting the service.
RestartSec=1s

# The number of steps to take to increase the interval of auto-restarts from RestartSec= to RestartMaxDelaySec= (V254+).
#RestartSteps=5

# The longest time to sleep before restarting a service as the interval goes up with RestartSteps= (V254+).
#RestartMaxDelaySec=5m

# The service will be restarted if the process fails.

# Sent a SIGINT when shutting down which Python will see as a CTRL + C.
KillSignal=SIGINT

# This service does not currently spawn new processes and only uses one thread (the urllib one), for additional security we restrict them.

# The processes of this unit will be run in their own private file system (mount) namespace with all mount propagation from the processes towards the host's main file system namespace turned off.
